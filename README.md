# Level_DOB_Telescope
A Level For Levelness of Telescope (primarily used for DOB's)

Code is set for 0.5 Deg's Accuracy. Code reflects Calibration of the specific MPU-6050 being used (each 6050 can be different).
If inaccurate, User will need to learn how to Calibrate the MPU-6050 and tweak the code (search YouTube, Internet). 
If accuracy is Not far-off, you can use Shim's (paper/etc) under appropriate edge to compensate (it's much easier than Calibrating, especially for Non Geek's).

The Circuit is simple and does not require a Schematic. The version shown uses a PCB that I CNC-Milled but, you can use a BreadBoard or ProtoBoard-PCB... that's up to you.

The PCB-Graphic is all you need to gain the info for Wiring it and/or making a Schematic, if desired.

If the LED's are too Bright, increase the Resistor Values as needed. The LED's are Recessed below the Lid. If you want them High, then don't cut their leg's short - just ensure the Lid still fits or, enlarge the Holes... (or, ask me to do it...)

The 3D- .STL files are for the PCB version - make your own if not using PCB/Dimension's shown image (ignore the Decimal places as common-sense informs you).
The Box has Tab's that help align the Lid (no screws needed, just use some Glue (I use 'Shoe Glue' in a few locations so I can remove the Lid, if needed)...

This is Not Rocket-Science - if it works for you, Great, if not, move-on.  And, if questions or if wanting Tweaks, Modification's, new/custom 3D... just Ask...

Note: ThingiVerse seems to have trouble Publishing so, I'm posting it here, just in case... This will be the one I intend to maintain with updates
